# My PhD Research Notebook

In the spirit of Open Science, I present my electronic research notebook.

## Post organisation

Each post is akin to an entry or a page in a paper notebook. 

### Post Categories:

Posts are organised with the following `categories` (note that categories relate to the project area, rather than the content):

- `meeting`: notes taken in advance, during, and after a meeting.
- `reading`: these are notes I've taken from reading a single paper. 
- `first chapter`: any entry pertaining to work on the first chapter.
- `research proposal`: any entry pertaining to work on the research proposal.
- `planning`: This is an entry that pertains to any project planning, milestones, timelines etc.
- `todo`: posts that contain any todo's.
- `synthesis`: These are any posts that bring together ideas around a single theme, based on content covered in multiple posts.

All posts except `synthesis` should be written, committed, and then should be read-only thereafter. In contrast, `synthesis` posts are iterative works that are added to as I build more and more knowledge around that theme.

### Post Tags:

Tags denote the ideas / content covered in a post, and are essentially 'keywords'. I won't include a list here, because this will constantly be growing. See the 'tags' widget for a word-cloud of all tags.

## Deploying the notebook to github

I followed the instructions here: [https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)

To deploy changes to website, run:
```
 ./deploy.sh "Your optional commit message" 
```
Changes will be sent to to egouldo.github.io. Don't forget to commit changes to the notebook repository as well.
