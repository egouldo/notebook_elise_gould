<p>Planning the projects and the scope of the Phd (and the format for the thesis):</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfectly acceptable to have disparate projects / papers comprising the thesis, and bound together with a good introduction and conclusion.</li>
<li>Don’t have to choose between different projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good to try and sit with that tension, and not having to resolve it by having a neat / tightly fitting narrative thesis.</p>
<p>Hannah: working on structured decision making tool with Libby. Would appreciate having guidance on how to avoid reproducibility issues / QRPs during the process.</p>
<p>Thursdays sit in with Fiona and Hannah.</p>
<p>Where to start to begin picking up momentum again: - just start at the easiest point…. Have done a lot of work on the systematic review plan, let’s start there.</p>
<p>Time for advisory committee meeting: - send email off…. week of the 28th of May.</p>
