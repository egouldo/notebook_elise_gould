**Problem** The authors aim to address the problem of false conclusions arisng during inference of joint species distribution models -- specifically, false conclusions of biotic interactions.

**Approach** The authors conduct a review of joint species distribution modelling to identify (from caveats and other issues ear-marked in the source papers) potential factors that confound interpretation of analyses. Next, they develop a series of questions that can be asked by the analyst and also the reviewer to guide interpretation of conclusions -- are the conclusions about biotic interactions plausible? 

**Point in analysis where QRP might arise**
