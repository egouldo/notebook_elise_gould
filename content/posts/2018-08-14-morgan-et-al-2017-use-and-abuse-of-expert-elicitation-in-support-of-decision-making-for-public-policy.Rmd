Morgan [-@Morgan:2014fn] present a review of expert elicitation methods for decision support in public policy. I reviewed this paper looking for information on how to design my methods for the expert eliciation of judgments about the consequences of particular research practices on the risk of a type I error in models used in decision support in ecology and conservation.

# Article Summary

## Estimation tasks - framing the question

The upper and lower bounds should be elicited first, before asking for a best guess. This is due to cognitive heuristics and bias coming into play, chiefly, anchoring and adjustment. This is pertinent, because I will be asking experts to undertake an estimation task of the consequence of a given QRP. The process below describes elicitation of a full cumultive probability distribution. I am not yet sure whether I aim to elicit a probability distribution, or just use some 3-point elicitation technique.

## Question difficulty and accuracy of expert judgment - estimation aids

If we wish to obtain accurate estimates, then framing the question in a way that is 'easy' for the participant to conceptualise and quantify the estimation task is important.

> Lichtenstein et al. (41) found that probability judgments tend to be too high 
> when questions are hard, and too low when questions are easy, where “hard” and 
> “easy” questions were classified in terms of the percentage of correct answers 
> made by a reference group.

So why is a question easy or difficult to answer? We can help enable the expert to keep all factors influencing the elicited variable of interest:
This cognitive heuristic is termed 'availability'. 

We want to minimise the impact of this heuristic on the experts ability to quantify their best-considered judgment. We can do so by using graphical aids, for example:

> The best experts have comprehensive mental models of all of the various factors 
> that may influence the value of an uncertain quantity, as well as which of those 
> factors most contribute to its uncertainty. However, not all of that knowledge 
> may be comparably accessible. Because the objective of an elicitation should be 
> to obtain each expert’s best-considered judgment, it is important to help them 
> keep all of those factors in mind as they answer specific questions in an 
> elicitation. To assist in that process, we have often used a variety of 
> graphical aids such as summary tables and influence diagrams to illustrate the 
> relation between key factors that influence the value of interest. For a simple 
> example see pages 4 and 5 of the protocol used in Curtright et al. (20) 
> (available at http://pubs. acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/es8014088/suppl_file/ 
> es8014088_si_001.pdf).

Morgan describes a card sorting exercise, and the aim of which is to:

> differentiate between the strength of 
> influences versus sources of uncertainty, and to focus on the most important of 
> the latter in formulating their probabilistic responses.

So this should be the aim of the evidence / information we present in the elicitation survey.

> Using specialized software tools to summarize literature or construct influence 
> diagram or similar aides can also be very helpful.

But we need to be careful when interpreting the results of the elicitation... One issue with using computer tools (i.e. automated delivery of the survey) is that people spend less time, and less consideration in working out their estimates. Should consider this caveat in the discussion section.

> Such tools might be useful if used in conjunction with a face-to-face 
> elicitation. It is an open question whether experts working on their own will 
> devote the same degree of serious consideration in responding to an automated 
> elicitation system that they clearly do when responding to a well-developed 
> protocol during a face-to-face interview with attentive and technically 
> knowledgeable interviewers sitting with them in their office.

Further support for the use of graphical / information aids during elicitation:

> Most of the elicitations my colleagues and I have performed have been conducted 
> using face-to-face interviews in experts’ offices where the expert can readily 
> access relevant data and analytic and model results. In many cases, we have 
> prepared concise literature summaries or other materials and have used card 
> sorting and other tasks to encourage experts to systematically identify all 
> relevant factors that may influence a value of interest or contribute to its 
> uncertainty. Although well-informed experts obviously know and have thought 
> about all of these things, it is important to make sure that they do not 
> overlook any of them when they are asked to make quantitative judgments.

## Objectives of the task and expert selection

> In contrast to political or similar polling, the objective of most expert

> responsible expert judgments and interpretations across the field of interest.

**How to choose experts?**

Careful reading of the literature, discussion with experts.

## Approach to designing the elicitation protocol

Should be thoughtful, well-considered. Go through several iterations of development, as well as testing using non-experts and experts. (Not everyone agrees though!)

## Presenting results

**Capturing alternative schools of thought**

![Figure 8 from Morgan (2014): An example of visualising differences in alternative underlying causal models](../../static/posts/2018-08-14-morgan-et-al-2017-use-and-abuse-of-expert-elicitation-in-support-of-decision-making-for-public-policy_files/Morgan-2014-Fig_8-expert_elicitation.png)

- [ ] It could be interesting to look at how assessment about the severity of the practice vary depending on value judgments (i.e. about whether the research practice under consideration is defensible or not).

## Combining Expert Judgments

When considering if and how to aggregate, it's important to consider that some participants may have different underlying causal models informing their estimates, and so should not be combined:

> While Cooke’s method has been used in a number of applications (8, 49), it is 
> potentially problematic in situations, such as the assessment of health damage 
> functions or various quantities in climate science in which different experts 
> make very different assumptions about the nature of the underlying causal 
> mechanisms. As noted above, depending on how the results will be used, combining 
> the judgments of experts (by any procedure) may not be appropriate. It would 
> also be problematic if one were to exclude some experts who represent plausible 
> but poorly represented alternative views about the science. The history of 
> science is replete with examples in which the minority opinion about uncertain 
> science ultimately proved to be correct.

In the case of the QRP study... the underlying conceptual models refer BOTH to the model / scenario used in the survey, the interpretation of that information by the survey participant, and also their understanding of research practice and its influence on the model output / result at hand.

# QRP Elicitation Protocol Development Tasks

*Elicitation Protocol design*

- Articulate the objective/s of the elicitation
- Specify the quantity being estimated
- How to frame the question (influenced by the quantity being estiamted, as well as potential cognitive biases and heuristics coming into play)

*Results and analysis*

- How to aggregate across individuals (determined by the objectives... characterise schools of thought across body of researchers?)
- How to present results graphically? (schools of thought, aggregation across researchers?)
