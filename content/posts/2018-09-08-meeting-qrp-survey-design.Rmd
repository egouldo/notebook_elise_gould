## Survey Design

### Estimating Prevalence and Risk of QRPs

$Risk = Likelihood \times Consequence$

**Risk**

% `papers` or `researchers` engaging in the practice.

If `researchers`:

- can compare the number of estimated vs. self-reported? Some interesting questions about whether self reporters estimate the prevalence to be greater than non-self reporters, is the self reported rate lower than the estimated rate?
- In the discussion section, might be able to interpret in the context of other QRP papers, like Fraser et al. Directly comparable measures (minus the sample of course).

If `papers`, might be able to measure directly some of these, e.g. during the systematic review. This would only work for some particular QRPs, namely the "failure to report" practices.


**Consequence**

How to estimate or elicit judgments about this?

1. Use the proportion of those who say it is "definitely" unacceptable, (and/or) "maybe" unacceptable, as a proxy for the severity of the practice (e.g. the voting exercise we discussed last time).

> Do you consider the practice defensible? (Yes, No, Maybe or Depends, Unsure?).

- But this doesn't really get at the degree to which the practice is likely to cause a type I error. Some practices might be more severe than others in how they skew the model to a positive signal/finding.

2. Elicit judgment about how likely it is that the practice will result in a false positive.

> What is the chance (0 - 100%) that the practice will artificially skew the model/analysis to a positive signal / finding?

### question order and truth-telling

Plain language statement: using the term "questionable", as in "questionable reserach practices"? Does that prevent participants from being forth-coming in their self reporting of engaging in these practices?

Question order: Ask participants to estimate the prevalence of these practices first? "If everyone else is doing it, then it must be ok".
