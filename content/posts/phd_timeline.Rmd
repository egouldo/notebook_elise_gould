Purpose of Confirmation:
The main purpose of the confirmation process is to determine if you have developed a detailed research plan together with your supervisor(s), to assess whether this research plan meets the requirements of the degree, and to assess if adequate progress has been made. The confirmation process is also a chance for an open and constructive discussion about your research plan.
