# Introduction

- well-referenced intro that explains scientific context of project (1 - 3 pages)



Science is a cumulative process building upon previous research to develop knowledge, however, this process requires that the findings are both real, and replicable [@Nakagawa:2015bn]. As the recent "reproducibility crisis" debate illustrates, this assumption is often incorrect [@Nature:un]. Failure to reproduce a large proportion of published studies has received considerable attention and provoked heated debate among researchers in the disciplines of psychology and medicine. 

Evidence for (ir)reproduciability
Highlight a couple of studies crying out that there is a reproducibility crisis.
- In a large-scale replication study only 36% of Psychology replications had significant results [@OpenScienceCollaboration:2015cn]

evidence for this "heated debate"?
is a crisis, there isn't? that the studies claiming there is a crisis are also wrong (used bad methods to reproduce).
Study that replicated those studies was unable to be replicated.

There is an inherent cost to ensure / increase reproducibility of an experiment or study [@Nature:un].. time (better documentation around methods for example) and therefore money 


## Repro Crisis Ecology

What is the state of the 'crisis' in ecology? Extent...? But can't measure!

Falling under the banner of 'reproducibility' are a number of different concepts. Moreover, there is disagreement among the scientific community as to how to define what a reproducible study actually is.

The reproducibility crisis in ecology and evolution is beginning to receive more attention.

Reproducibility crisis in ecology... outline recent work evidencing this.
Summarise the particular nuances of the reproducibility crisis in ecology.

## Defining Reproducibility in Ecology.

"broad term used to describe the ability to replicate an experiment or study and / or its outcomes." [@Fidler:2017he]

May be used inter-changably with the term 'replication'. 

Encompasses the ideas of repeatability (hard-copy book).

There are a number of different definitions / typologies of replications:
- [@Nakagawa:2015bn] 

## Decision Support Tools - Reproducibility 

Significant resources are invested in conservation and management. 
1. demonstrating credibility is important.
2. 

What is the risk that decision support tools are irreproducible? I.e. the consequences. Why is it worth examining.

Now move onto decision support tools - huge part of what we do in applied ecology. 
So how might a reproducibility crisis manifest in ecological decision support tools?


Decision models are built against an uncertain evidence base [@Law:2017ia].



# Project Aims and Outline

- an outline of the major aims of the project and the approaches that will be taken (1 - 2 pages)


target audience:

scope: Am i examining just models... or am I looking at the entire decision-making process... from specification of objectives, for example.. My feeling is that there are a lot of papers focusing on good / robust modelling practices within ecology / conservation in general, as well as articulating why models are necessary in decision-making. I think it could be useful to consider the entire process to developing the decision tool as a whole because aspects of the whole process may influence the final decision.. For example, Law et al.  [-@Law:2017ia] argue that decisions are sensitive to the scenarios selected during scenario analysis.
