# Introduction

IMportnat points to cover:
- non-NHST call.

Debate around whether there is a crisis. Some say that the narrative of a crisis is "mistaken", and argue that the 'crisis' should be rebranded as a narrative of 'eopchal changes and empowerment of scientists' [@Fanelli:2018je].

See [@Jamieson:2018kz] for an essay on communicating the shitstorm. 

I think the point I want to make is that, personally I think these are two different issues. I think there is evidence that we *can't reproduce or replicate many studies*, but whether we call this a crisis or a credibility revolution is a separate issue. Still important though!

Science is a cumulative process building upon previous research to develop knowledge, however, this process requires that the findings are both real, and replicable [@Nakagawa:2015bn]. As the recent "reproducibility crisis" debate illustrates, this assumption is often incorrect [@Nature:un]. Failure to reproduce a large proportion of published studies has received considerable attention and provoked heated debate among researchers in the disciplines of psychology and medicine. 

Evidence for (ir)reproduciability
Highlight a couple of studies crying out that there is a reproducibility crisis.
- In a large-scale replication study only 36% of Psychology replications had significant results [@OpenScienceCollaboration:2015cn]

evidence for this "heated debate"?
is a crisis, there isn't? that the studies claiming there is a crisis are also wrong (used bad methods to reproduce). just downloaded one now.
Study that replicated those studies was unable to be replicated.

There is an inherent cost to ensure / increase reproducibility of an experiment or study [@Nature:un].. time (better documentation around methods for example) and therefore money 

Very onerous to check code, eve.

See [@Williams:2017bg] for a good brief definition of replication / reproducibility using Peng.

## Repro Crisis Ecology

What is the state of the 'crisis' in ecology? Extent...? But can't measure!

Falling under the banner of 'reproducibility' are a number of different concepts. Moreover, there is disagreement among the scientific community as to how to define what a reproducible study actually is.

The reproducibility crisis in ecology and evolution is beginning to receive more attention.

Reproducibility crisis in ecology... outline recent work evidencing this.
Summarise the particular nuances of the reproducibility crisis in ecology.

## Defining Reproducibility in Ecology.

"broad term used to describe the ability to replicate an experiment or study and / or its outcomes." [@Fidler:2017he]

May be used inter-changably with the term 'replication'. 

Encompasses the ideas of repeatability (hard-copy book).

There are a number of different definitions / typologies of replications:
- [@Nakagawa:2015bn] 

## Decision Support Tools - Reproducibility 

What's a reproducible decision?? Transparency is touted as key to decision-making process to facilitate 'reproducible' decisions? But what does this actually mean:
"Transparency is a key feature of environmental decision-support systems, allowing stakeholders to structure conservation problems and potentially delivering defensible and reproducible decisions (McIntosh et al., 2011)" in [@Kim:2016gf]. [@McIntosh:2011ew]: "Transparent because rational explanations can be provided to support decisions, and because the user/stakeholder/citizen can reproduce the decision procedure, play with the weights, and perform sensitivity analysis to assess decision strength and robustness." .... So they are just saying that the procedure can be 'repeated' really. It's not really saying that the decision is reproducible. Just assuming that it is.


Significant resources are invested in conservation and management. 
1. demonstrating credibility is important.
2. 

What is the risk that decision support tools are irreproducible? I.e. the consequences. Why is it worth examining.

A quick set of definitions / glossary (table): define them here in a table.

Now move onto decision support tools - huge part of what we do in applied ecology. 
So how might a reproducibility crisis manifest in ecological decision support tools?


Decision models are built against an uncertain evidence base [@Law:2017ia].

## State of reproducibility research in ecology

There seems to be a growing body of work at the meta-research level, characterising the state of the problem at the disciplinary level.
In its infancy, work mostly focussed on trying to identify whether it's likely that we have a problem with reproducibility in ecology. Drawing on the body of work from fields in Medicine and Psychology, to a lesser extent Physics, Economics. Papers by Nakagawa, Parker, Fidler. These studies are synthesising across many ecological studies.

At the other end of the spectrum there is a decent body of work focusing on the level of the individual researcher / study. This literature examines the data analysis pipeline for a single analysis or study, and is largely software and data focussed. It could be described as falling under the banner of "reproducible research", "scientific computing". It's technically-minded and solutions-focussed, and seems to really be drawing on the notion of reproducibility as being computational or direct in nature, rather than on replications. Solutions are largely software-based. And take the starting point of reproducibility to be at the point where analysis is ready to begin (you've got the data already!). Draws largely on the work of computational biology.

**Examples:**
- [@Wilson:2014ck] describes a set of practices for improving reproducibility of analyses in many quantitative research settings, e.g. version control, incremental changes, functional programming, plannning for mistakes using unit-testing...etc.
- literatre programming and Rmarkdown documents for portable, containerised analyses linked to their inferences, e.g.: [@Baumer:2015hc] and [@Gandrud:2016ux]
- [@White:2013ea] how to make your data re-usable to others for replications, or whatever. But also on how to maek it reproducible for yourself. emphasis on ecological data (types.)
- BES's guide to data management [@BritishEcologicalSociety:2014va]
- Organizing computaitonal biology projects [@Noble:2009da] not ecol specific, but biol specific
- Best practices for reporting climate data in ecology. Guideliens for individual researchers, but witha  view of creating transparency and reporting standards for editors, and reviewers [@MoruetaHolme:2018bi]
- [@Evolution:cl] describe technical and cultural issues that need to be addressed to aid archiving more data in Eco/Evo. target the best-practice guideliens for data creators, data users (i.e. researchers synthesising data), and for journal editors and publishers.
- again another ecoinformatics paper, breaking down the research data life-cycle, 

Then there is research focussing on the the reproducibility of particular tools or methods used to inform conservation decision-making, e.g. for Population Viability Analyses PVA. Morrison et al 2018 frontiers in ecology and evolution. [@Morrison:2016cd]. This is a step towards understanding that reproducible or "robust" decisions aren't just those that follow a transparent process... but "scientific input into conservation plannign [must be] robust and reliable, thereby increasing the chances of making decisions that are both beneficial and defensible". So it views decisions in this broader context. Also! reallly cool paper because it tried to directly repeat and reproduce a bunch of PVA's systematically. cool.


### open data and sharing

Then there's also a push to *share* data in ecology "open data" and science more broaldy. this work is less likely to only consider the researcher / study in its own right, and consider issues of reproducibility within a broader systems-level view: treating openness as precurser for a) fostering greater rates of replication, by making individual studies more readily reproducible (computationally / directly) [@Merali:2010tw]. Importantly, there is recognition that issues around reproducibility and openness as pertaining to the technical limitations of individual researchers are actually inter-generational and cultural: As ecologists, scientists more generally, we mostly aren't trained in software development, but have picked bits and pieces up along the way / are self-taught (i.e. we lack a formal training) [@Merali:2010tw]. The same point has been made about statistical training of ecologsts (CITE... context of QRPs???). Consequently proponents of openness also advocate for collaboration of ecologists with software developers and computer scientists and for bringing industrial software practices into the workflows of labs and research groups [@Merali:2010tw]. 

QRP study: [@Agnoli:2017kl]

Some proponents of openness argue that transparency (access to source code, and links to data) is not enough -- too onerous to have researchers check data line by line in replications [@Merali:2010tw]. There are technical solutions from the Computer science / reproducible research areas that aim to alleviate this barrier to checking the reproducibility of papers, e.g. E.g. $R^2$ the executable papers platform for the R community [@Leisch:2011hf]. Aimed to remove the burden of checking computational reproducibility off reviewers by providing a "new web service which outsources validation of computational results in executable papers to an independent third party." It's one solution to the issue of reviewers and journals having to check this (some journals have hired statiscial reviewrs and programmers to address this sticking point for reproducibility (CITE)).


"The combination of for- mal systems for tracking provenance, and fed- erated data repositories like DataONE that provide unique identifiers for every data object, will be instrumental in realizing the goal of fully reproduc- ible science in support of understanding global environmental issues such as climate change, species invasions, and epidemics" data sharing should facilitate "as well as greater reproducibility and transparency of the methods and analyses that support scientific insights."


Openness work still largely considers reproducibility to be computational or direct reproducibility.

likely to consider transparency and openness as precursers for replications. Not only considering computational reproducibility.

Openness work Still technically focussed:
- individual reseracher solutions to facilitating data-sharing  in ECOLOGY (e.g. meta-data), but with a view to combining data with other data in the future - i.e. facilitating longitudinal studies, reuse for other questions (other data parasites), or replications  / reproducibility studies [@White:2013ea] 
- [@TorontoInternationalDataReleaseWorkshopAuthors:2009jh] Pre-publication data-sharing. 
- [@Anonymous:a1kBf1q9] "Git can facilitate greater reproducibility and increased transparency in science"
-  Not enough just to provide source code and links to data. Get scientists and software developers working together. Develop code in modular fashion so that can easily add new analyses. Bring Computer scientists into research groups.
- [@Merali:2010tw] Lots of technical solutions. Short survey of the opennes problem and how it impedes reproducibility. Examines issues around transparency with a focus on scientific software and code development by scientists.
- Calls for scientists to publish computer code with paper [@Barnes:2010dn], with solutions focus on the individual researcher.

Other Openness papers Policy-focussed approaches considering reproducibility and studies in the context of a broader ecosystem of research in which reproducibility is impacted by some broader culture:
- Other calls looking at barriers / lack of standards beyond the individual researcher that prevent scientists publishing code - AKA "source-code withholding" (institutional support, funding policy, publishing requirement - journal level) [@Science:2012hf].
- Scientific computing studies also consider this broader ecosystem (R2 paper), and address issues of policy: [@Stodden:2012ww]. Highlights jouranl poolicy and funding agency, but misses publishing requirements, as the paper above included. This study also argues that it's not just about source-code but about the whole process, from the dev environment to the complete set of instructions that generated the figures, and paper.
- post-publication data sharing: publication level standards / policy, licensing schema and accompanying data and resource-sharing infrastructure, incentives [@Gribbin:2009us]
- Empirical evidence looking at trends in openness policy in terms of data sharing: [@Stodden:2013ho].



Both metaresearch work and reproducible research / open science / data advocates tend to consider reserach in the broader context, and offer policy-based approaches that target the journal editors, funding agencies, and publishing requirements (some technical, e.g. post-publication paper).





# Project Aims and Outline 

- an outline of the major aims of the project and the approaches that will be taken (1 - 2 pages)

Provide further insight and deepen the understanding of issues of reproducibility and transparency in ecology and conservation decision making.

1. Develop an understanding / framework / definition of reproducibility that is applicable to Non-NHST and translational research, that is sensitive to the particularities of the data, the methods, the questions commonly used within these contexts.
2. Build a picture / conceptual model of ecological informatics with a reproducibility bent, multi-level.
2. Characterise the extent and magnitude of the "problem."reproducibility crisis"
3. Devise (and possibly test) interventions for improving reproducibility and transparency in ecology and conservation. improving the scientific process in ECO / CDM. Could be policy-based, could be guidelines  targeted at the author, could be a technical tool.

target audience:

scope: Am i examining just models... or am I looking at the entire decision-making process... from specification of objectives, for example.. My feeling is that there are a lot of papers focusing on good / robust modelling practices within ecology / conservation in general, as well as articulating why models are necessary in decision-making. I think it could be useful to consider the entire process to developing the decision tool as a whole because aspects of the whole process may influence the final decision.. For example, Law et al.  [-@Law:2017ia] argue that decisions are sensitive to the scenarios selected during scenario analysis.

## Paper 1 - Systematic Review

## Paper 2 - DSS Protocol Development

## Paper 3 - How do you replicate a DST?

One thing to test for in the replication:

Bower et al [-@Bower:2017im] argue that problem formulation is a crucial first step in any CDM process. However, they state that " If parties to the decision process do not have a clear, shared idea of the problem itself, then entering into an SDM process is recommended. Specific techniques outlined in Table 1 can then be used to help clarify problem formulation." Page 4, [@Bower:2017im].  Wonder if that is robust enough, and how you measure the definition of the problem... line of inquiry for review.. Are decisions generated from DSS's developed with an SDM framework more reproducible than those that are not?

It's worth trying to get a handle on this... because these more rigorous decision protocols have a cost to them and "Unfortunately, insufficient resources often constrain smaller conservation agencies’ capacity for strictly following rigorous decision protocols." Page 4, [@Bower:2017im]. Bower et al suggest using truncated versions of these protocols, such that the decision process is still transparent.

## Ecological Informatics / Reproducibility Roadmap

Michener et al define ecoinformatics as a "framework that enables scientists to generate new knowledge through innovative tools and approaches for discovering, managing, integrating, analyzing, visualising and preserving relevant biological, environmental, and socioeconomic data and information".

So perhaps I could extend an ecoinformatics model to account for translational research... i.e. one that accounts for the knowledge-doing gap.

PhD output: could be a thinkpiece, or might be the literature review or a chapter for the thesis (check the guidelines, you need one in addition to a published one)... But could be a real intervention... a technical solution.. like a small-scale / pilot, perhaps using Qaeco's task, data archiving repository that uses semantic annotation and ontologies.What would be the point of this?? There are already repositories in existance that do this... But do they do ontology-driven integration? Could build something that implements this... Payal's database problem.

What: Building an informatics for ecology (and decision suport systems as a part of this, to bridge the knowledge-doing gap).

Why: Sketching out this conceptual model of an informatics for ecology will aid me (and, actually, researchers / science in general) in highlighting potential avenues of future research. What parts of this 'macchine' can I focus on? What needs to be done.

Need to describe the  flow and transformation of information into knowledge, in a research 'ecosystem', But with sufficient detail at various levels e.g. enough insight into a single research pipeline for a single study, but also need to consider how data / information fits together at a disciplinary level / evidence-base level. E.g. We need data and resource sharing infrastructure, e.g. as suggested by [@Gribbin:2009us]: to prevent scientists from re-inventing the wheel [@Merali:2010tw], but importantly in a decision-tool context, to aid in evidence / data retrieval, selection to build models.

For conservation, there's this 'knowing-doing' gap. ANd an interesting set pf relations between practitioners and researcheres. Need to capture what Fiona called the  "translational research" element of decision-making reserach for conseration in our informatics.

Understanding the components of this system, and what their properties are... am I building an 'ontology'? See Culina paper and also Madin (2007)...: "Ontologies are formal models that define concepts and their relationships within a scientific domain such as ecology". Hmmm. Digging further.. not quite... More of a directed conceptual model.

### What makes ecological data special?
- [@White:2013ea]
- [@Borregaard:2018gu]
- [@Madin:2008jv] ontologies for ecology... talk about the specifics of ecological data. Concluding remarks section has good discussion on changing landscape of ecological work and data landscape.. integrative / synthetic approaches to dealing with data.
- [@Jones:2007fv] metadata-driven framework for generating field data entry interfaces in ecology
- "Page 1
One challenge that is particularly daunting lies in dealing with the scope of ecology and the enormous variability in scales that is encountered, spanning microbial community dynamics, communities of organisms inhabiting a single plant or square meter, and ecological Page 1

processes occurring at the scale of the continent and biosphere. The diversity in scales studied and the ways in which studies are carried out results in large numbers of small, idiosyncratic data sets that accumulate from the thousands of scientists that collect relevant biological, ecological and environmental data
[18] 
Page 2
Such heterogeneity can be attributed, in part, to methodological specialization to address specific scientific hypotheses, but also to a lack of standard protocols for acquiring, organizing and describing data and language barriers and cultural differences across disciplines, institutions and countries.
"

How does ecology differ from other disciplines? Madin 2008 paper... lack of formalised terms and concepts... It's seen a a 'soft-science'




The data landscape of ecology is changing..
Newer synthetic approaches to ecological analyses, that are often cross-disciplinary (this was in 2008).

"Ecologists increasingly address questions at broader scales that have both scientific and societal relevance", [@Michener:2012ho]. Affected by changes occurring in science more broadly, and so there is growing emphasis on data stewardship sharing, openness [@Michener:2012ho].


### Problems (with regard to ecological data storage and accessibility)

Ecology's filedrawer problem:
In ecology and evolutionary biology, most data that is collected is lost to science, and are never accessible to anyone other than the original collector or user [@Evolution:cl]. That excludes summaries posted in publications. Then, eventually many data are lost, even to the original collector [@Evolution:cl].
But the foundation of science is data - information about the natural world obtained through experiment and observation.


Data collected, often for a targeted purpose, without considering how it might be reused for broader projects and analyses [@Madin:2008jv]. Aimed to be used within respective projects only. Data owners are the only intended users, and information about structure, content and usage is not recorded. IMO probably because the data creator has this mental understanding of the data and doesn't need it.
"As ecological research becomes holistic and integrative, better approaches are needed " [@Madin:2008jv]. In Conservation Decision Making, I think this was always already an issue. 

"Current data practices in ecology are not amenable to data sharing and re-use." Spreadsheet models, or even more sophisticated database frameworks don't have the necessary information to facilitate long-term preservation and interpretation of data. There are good approaches, but ontology-based approaches are rare. "Thus, the adoption of ontolo- gies is hindered both by the familiarity of current practices and the lack of tools to readily migrate to improved prac- tices."  [@Madin:2008jv]

"Long-tail" of ecological research [@Culina:2018dn]: "many individual projects producing small-scale data" has not embraced the open data movement. But some fields in ecology and evolution that are characterised by 'big data' have embraced open data. Authors think that it is the heterogeneous nature of ecological research (e.g. specific taxa, systems, regions or methodologies) that have impeded uptake.

**increasing use and establishment of data repositories / open data in Eco/Evo**
There is increasing demand for the use of open data in ecology and evolutionary biology. One example is that there is a need to "identify broader ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes across species, space and time " [@Culina:2018dn]. Two other such uses are 1. facilitating meta-analyses, and replications. 2. Conservation decision making and decision support!! Translational research of ecological research into decision support systems and then into decisions. 3. "re-analysis of data using new statistical iapproaches, error checking or use of existing data to address new questions "

Increasing data deposits are driven by policies of journals or funding agencies to encourage or require data archiving as part of the publication process [@Evolution:cl]. Lots!!! of ecological repositories now (table 2 of [@Michener:2012ho])

The two functions of open data archiving [@Evolution:cl]:
1. error checking and verification of results. As well as a method for preventing and correcting misconduct, although it is likely rare.
2. data to be re-used for broader meta-analyses, and for addressing new questions.

## What makes applied ecological work / conservation special?

Need to unpack what we do in decision support for ecology. what sorts of models / analysis do we use? not NHST. often building predictive models. Law paper. Conservation decision-making and evidence work

So, in conservation-decision making, we need to be aware of the technical issues around reusing and synthesising data -- Culina et al [-@Culina:2018dn] highlight an example where two different meta-analyses wrongly concluded tehre was no net loss of biodiversity due to spatial biases in collected data sets. 

## Conservation evidence-base - "DATA LANDSCAPE"
Lots of good papers writing about this, I believe they can help inform my understanding of reproducibility issues for ecology



### Conservation Decision-making and translational research

Conservation decision making according to Bower: "Conservation practitioners face complex challenges due to resource limitations, biological and socioeconomic trade-offs, involvement of diverse interest groups, and data deficiencies".

Bridging the knowledge-doing gap. This stuff will cover the evidence base / conservation literature.
