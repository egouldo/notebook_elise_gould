# Introduction

- well-referenced intro that explains scientific context of project (1 - 3 pages)


## Repro Crisis Ecology

Reproducibility crisis in ecology... outline recent work evidencing this.
Summarise the particular nuances of the reproducibility crisis in ecology.

**Reproducibility, define:**
"broad term used to describe the ability to replicate an experiment or study and / or its outcomes." [@Fidler:2017he]

May be used inter-changably with the term 'replication'. 

Encompasses the ideas of repeatability (hard-copy book).

There are a number of different definitions / typologies of replications:
- [@Nakagawa:2015bn] 

## Decision Support Tools - Reproducibility 

What is the risk that decision support tools are irreproducible? I.e. the consequences. Why is it worth examining.

Now move onto decision support tools - huge part of what we do in applied ecology. 
So how might a reproducibility crisis manifest in ecological decision support tools?


Decision models are built against an uncertain evidence base [@Law:2017ia].



# Project Aims and Outline

- an outline of the major aims of the project and the approaches that will be taken (1 - 2 pages)


target audience:

scope: Am i examining just models... or am I looking at the entire decision-making process... from specification of objectives, for example.. My feeling is that there are a lot of papers focusing on good / robust modelling practices within ecology / conservation in general, as well as articulating why models are necessary in decision-making. I think it could be useful to consider the entire process to developing the decision tool as a whole because aspects of the whole process may influence the final decision.. For example, Law et al.  [-@Law:2017ia] argue that decisions are sensitive to the scenarios selected during scenario analysis.

## Paper 1

Systematic Review

## Paper 2
